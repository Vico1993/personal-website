# Basic react repo

This repo is my basic setup for a simple react application.
It's setup using Vite + react router.
I followed [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial) tutorial

## Basic NPM command

1. Build the project:

```Shell
npm run buildÂ 
```

2. Dev setup

```Shell
npm run dev
```

3. Use eslint:

```Shell
npm run lint
```
