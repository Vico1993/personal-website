# Victor Piolin

This repo contain my personal website hosts at [victorpiolin.com](https://www.victorpiolin.com/).
It's a basic React project

## Basic NPM command

1. Build the project:

```Shell
npm run buildÂ 
```

2. Dev setup

```Shell
npm run dev
```

3. Use eslint:

```Shell
npm run lint
```

## Edit content

For now the content is in [index.tsx](src/page/index.tsx), maybe one day we could use tools like [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/)
